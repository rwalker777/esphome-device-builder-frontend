 * carrying the upstream ``Debug Component`` name).
 *
 * Derived deterministically from the category id rather than a
 * translation table: maintaining N×locales chip labels for every
 * possible category drifts as new categories ship from the
 * sync script. Title-cases tokens, swallows the underscore
 * separator, and uppercases a small set of well-known
 * acronyms inline so ``audio_adc`` doesn't render as
 * "Audio Adc" and ``ota`` doesn't render as "Ota". The acronym
 * set is intentionally short — adding one is cheaper than
 * pulling in i18n for a chip — and only covers tokens that
 * appear as category-id components today (see
 * ``ComponentCategory`` in ``api/types.ts``).
 *
 * Lives in its own module so the title-casing + acronym
 * handling can be unit-tested without spinning up a DOM env to
 * render the card.
