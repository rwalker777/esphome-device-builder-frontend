/**
 * Shared "is this entry going to render?" filter for the
 * config-entry form.
 *
 * Two consumers need to agree on the answer for every entry:
 *
 * 1. ``ESPHomeConfigEntryForm._filterRenderable`` — decides which
 *    entries to actually paint into the DOM.
 * 2. ``ESPHomeAddComponentForm._anyErrorIsVisible`` — decides
 *    whether a validation error has any chance of being seen by
 *    the user (a red ring on a paint that's actually onscreen).
 *
 * If they diverge, validation can flag an error on an entry the
 * filter has dropped: the form bails on submit and the user sees
 * nothing — no red ring, no message — because the field isn't
 * onscreen. Pinning the predicate in one place avoids that.
 *
 * Returns the rendered list (rather than a boolean predicate) so
 * NESTED groups can be skipped when none of their children
 * survive — a child-aware decision the caller can't make
 * locally.
