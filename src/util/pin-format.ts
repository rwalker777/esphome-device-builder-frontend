/**
 * Display formatting for the receiver's identity fingerprint.
 *
 * The wire form of 'pin_sha256' is a contiguous 64-char
 * lowercase hex string carrying the SHA-256 of the
 * receiver's X25519 peer-link public key (the one paired
 * offloaders pin against during the Noise XX handshake).
 * For OOB verification -- the user reads the fingerprint off
 * the receiver's Build server card and compares to what
 * the sender's pair dialog observed on the wire --
 * space-separated byte pairs are easier to scan visually:
 *
 *   "abcdef0123456789..."  ->  "ab cd ef 01 23 45 67 89 ..."
 *
 * Mirrors the backend's 'DashboardIdentity.pin_sha256_formatted'
 * property so the frontend display matches what the receiver-side
 * Settings card shows on the dashboard's HTML rendering of its
 * own identity.

/**

 * pins via a separate "couldn't load identity" error path,
 * not by hiding malformed strings here.
 *
 * Returns an empty string for empty input.
