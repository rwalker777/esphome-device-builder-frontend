 *
 * Versions are ESPHome's ``YYYY.M[.P][-suffix]`` shape (e.g.
 * ``2026.5.0``, ``2026.5.0b1``, ``2026.5.0-dev``); year + month
 * advance in lockstep with the monthly ESPHome release.
 *
 * Returned shape:
 *   * ``null`` — versions match, or either side is unknown
 *     (handshake hasn't completed yet, dev build, …). Hide
 *     the sub-line.
 *   * ``"patch"`` — same year+month, patch / suffix differs.
 *     Informational; compile is almost always safe.
 *   * ``"release"`` — year+month differs. Cautionary; the
 *     YAML may reference fields the receiver's schema does
 *     not recognise (or vice versa).
