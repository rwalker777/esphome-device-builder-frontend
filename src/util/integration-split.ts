/**
 * Split a device's `loaded_integrations` into two buckets:
 * directly-written and auto-loaded.
 *
 * The backend exposes `loaded_integrations` (every integration
 * the upstream `esphome` resolver pulled in at compile time) and
 * `directly_referenced_integrations` (the subset the user
 * literally wrote in YAML — top-level keys plus
 * `- platform: <name>` stems). The complement of the second
 * against the first is the AUTO_LOAD dependency chain (e.g.
 * `md5` from WPA2 password hashing, `mdns` from `api`,
 * `web_server_base` from `web_server`, `voltage_sampler` from
 * ADC sensors).
 *
 * Issue #422: the device-drawer's "Loaded Integrations" panel
 * was rendering the flat `loaded_integrations` list, drowning
 * the user-meaningful entries in framework noise for any
 * non-trivial config. This helper produces the per-bucket
 * lists the drawer renders inline (direct) vs collapsed
 * (indirect / auto-loaded).
 *
 * Order is stable: each bucket preserves the relative order
 * of its entries in the input `loaded_integrations` (which the
 * backend already sorts alphabetically).
 *
 * Graceful-degrade signal: when the backend couldn't resolve
 * the YAML — mid-edit drafts, missing secrets — it emits an
 * empty `directly_referenced_integrations` array. We treat
 * that as "split is unknown" (`splittable: false`) and put
 * everything into `direct` so the drawer renders the original
 * flat list under its existing header. Per-call branch in the
 * drawer's render template stays a one-liner.
