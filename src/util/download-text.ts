 * Trigger a browser save of *bytes* as *filename* via an

 *
 * Centralises the "create a Blob, mint an object URL, click a
 * synthetic anchor, revoke" dance that every save-to-disk
 * path in the dashboard needs. Behaviour:
 *
 * - ``bytes`` rides through a single ``Blob`` with the given
 *   MIME type. Binary firmware images pass
 *   ``application/octet-stream`` so the browser doesn't try to
 *   sniff the type; text-shaped output (logs, manifests) passes
 *   ``text/plain``.
 * - ``filename`` is offered to the browser's save dialog as-is —
 *   callers own slug / extension shaping.
 * - The object URL is revoked synchronously after the click.
 *   Chromium / Firefox both keep the in-flight download alive
 *   after revocation; the URL just stops resolving for *new*
 *   reads. Holding the URL around would leak the underlying
 *   ``Blob`` for the page's lifetime.
 *
 * Private helper — call sites use :func:`downloadAnsiText` rather than
 * touching this directly. (Binary artifacts download natively via
 * :func:`triggerDownload`, which streams from a URL and skips this.)

 * streams the response straight to disk, so it scales to large artifacts (the

 * are unreliable. The server's ``Content-Disposition`` names the saved file;
