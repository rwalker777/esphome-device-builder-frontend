/**
 * Tests for the leave-guard navigation primitives.
 *
 * The pattern: pages with unsaved-changes state register a guard
 * via ``setLeaveGuard``; the in-app Back / logo / command-palette
 * paths all funnel through ``navigate()``, which awaits the guard
 * before pushing the new URL. The discard / save resolution races
 * with that ``await``, so the contract has to hold:
 *
 *   1. ``navigate()`` calls the registered guard exactly once
 *      before mutating history.
 *   2. ``navigate()`` short-circuits without touching history when
 *      the guard resolves ``false``.
 *   3. ``navigate()`` proceeds to ``pushState`` + dispatch a
 *      synthetic popstate when the guard resolves ``true``.
 *   4. ``setLeaveGuard(null)`` removes the guard so subsequent
 *      navigations are unconditional.
 *   5. Without any guard registered, ``navigate()`` always
 *      proceeds.
 *
 * The MasterOfNone bug (Discard does nothing on the in-app Back
 * button while the visual editor's Save left ``_isDirty=true``)
 * traced to the synthetic popstate that ``navigate()`` fires
 * being re-intercepted by the device-page's popstate guard. The
 * fix landed in ``pages/device.ts`` (``_onLeaveDiscard`` /
 * ``_onLeaveSave`` flip ``_allowingLeave=true`` before resolving),
 * but the tests here pin the underlying ``navigate`` contract so
 * a future refactor that drops the synthetic popstate or skips
 * the guard surfaces immediately.
