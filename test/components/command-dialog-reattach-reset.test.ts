/**

 * The command dialog is a reused singleton: clicking a job in firmware-tasks
 * reattaches via the public followJob without going through open()/startCommand.
 * That path must clear per-session flags, else a prior install's missing-upload
 * failure leaves _installMissingUpload set and suppresses the clean/reset hint
 * on a subsequently-replayed real build failure. Pin the reset here.
