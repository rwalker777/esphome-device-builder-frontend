# ESPHome Device Builder Dashboard — Frontend

A web-based dashboard for managing, configuring, and deploying ESPHome IoT device firmware. Built with Lit web components and TypeScript.

> **This repository contains the frontend source only.** The dashboard runs as part of the **[ESPHome Device Builder Dashboard backend](https://github.com/esphome/device-builder-dashboard-backend)**, which ships a prebuilt copy of this frontend bundled in. End users should follow the install / run instructions in the backend repo — there's nothing to deploy from here on its own.

## Tech stack

- **[Lit](https://lit.dev/)** — Web components framework
- **TypeScript** — Strict mode throughout
- **[Rspack](https://rspack.dev/)** — Rust-based bundler
- **[Web Awesome](https://www.webawesome.com/)** — UI component library (Home Assistant variant)
- **[CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)** — YAML editor with syntax highlighting
- **[Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.dev/)** — Toast notifications

## Issues

Please file bug reports and feature requests on the **[backend issue tracker](https://github.com/esphome/device-builder-dashboard-backend/issues)** — UI issues live there too so we can triage everything in one place. The new-issue chooser on this repo only surfaces links to the right places.

## Contributing — local development

The rest of this README is for developers working on the frontend itself. If you just want to run the dashboard, head over to the [backend repo](https://github.com/esphome/device-builder-dashboard-backend) and follow its setup.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (with npm)
- A running ESPHome backend on `localhost:6052` — clone and run [device-builder-dashboard-backend](https://github.com/esphome/device-builder-dashboard-backend) in dev mode in a separate terminal

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts an HMR dev server at `http://localhost:5173`. WebSocket and REST traffic are proxied to the backend at `localhost:6052`.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs the bundled assets into `esphome_device_builder_frontend/` — that directory doubles as the Python package source for the wheel that ships with the backend release. The `__init__.py` exposing the asset path is sourced from `public/__init__.py` and copied into place by the bundler.

To produce the wheel locally (matches what CI builds on release):

```bash
npm run build
python3 -m build --wheel
# wheel ends up in dist/
```

### Other scripts

| Script           | Description                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run lint`   | TypeScript type-check (`tsc --noEmit`)     |
| `npm test`       | Run the Vitest suite once                  |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode                |
| `npm run format` | Format `src/` with Prettier                |

## Releases

Releases are produced by GitHub Actions:

- `release.yml` — manual trigger (or called from `auto-release.yml`). Tags the version, drafts release notes from PR labels, builds the Python wheel, attaches it to the GitHub release, then opens or updates a single bump PR on the backend repo so it can pick up the new wheel URL.
- `auto-release.yml` — nightly cron that auto-releases when ≥ 2 commits have landed since the last release.
- `dependabot.yml` + `auto-approve-dependabot.yml` — weekly npm + Actions bumps with auto-approve.

The backend's `pyproject.toml` references the wheel by GitHub release URL (no PyPI), so a release here is everything needed to ship a new dashboard build.

## Status

### Disabled features

The frontend is wired up for some features the backend doesn't expose yet. Anything in this list is gated behind a flag in [`src/feature-flags.ts`](src/feature-flags.ts) — flip the flag to re-enable once the backend lands.

- **Automations** (`AUTOMATIONS_ENABLED`) — the navigator's "Automations" group is still visible and lists existing automations parsed from the YAML, but the "+ Add automation" action button is greyed out (and the underlying dialog isn't mounted). The ESPHome WebSocket API doesn't yet expose the endpoints the UI needs to add new ones (catalog of triggers / conditions / actions, schema lookups, save-back hooks). Re-enable by setting `AUTOMATIONS_ENABLED = true` once those land.
